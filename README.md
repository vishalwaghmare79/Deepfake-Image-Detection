# Deepfake-Image-Detection

## Project Overview

The Deepfake Image Detection project aims to identify manipulated images created using deepfake technology. This project utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies to create a robust solution for detecting deepfakes. 

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Python, TensorFlow

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload images for analysis.
- **Detection Algorithm:** Utilizes TensorFlow to analyze and detect deepfake content.
- **User Interface:** Built with React to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- **Results Display:** Provides clear and actionable results based on the detection analysis.

## Description

In this project, I developed a web-based application where users can upload images to check for deepfake manipulations. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and React, ensures a responsive and interactive user experience. The backend leverages Python and TensorFlow for image processing and deepfake detection, employing machine learning techniques to analyze image authenticity. This project showcases my ability to integrate various technologies to solve complex problems and highlights my proficiency in both frontend and backend development.
